	<h2><p align="justify">"Blessed and cursed by the fact that ears do not have "earlids", he listens to the world like your film depends on it -- and that's because it does. From freezing whole casts and crews on sets in order to get the perfect room tone, to positively stomping around things on the Foley stage, having conversations in the ADR booth, creating effects than can affect, and latching his brain on apparent Pro Tools havoc until the printmasters are ready, he has made his presence invisible in a few films, features, shorts (e.g. <a href="film.html#recuerdo">¿Por qué el recuerdo? (The Solitude of Memory)</a>, <i>dir. Juan Pablo González</i> (Mexico/U.S.A.) - Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary Short - Slamdance Film Festival 2015; <a href="film.html#recuerdo">Skunk</a>, <i>dir. Annie Silverstein</i> (U.S.A.) - First Prize - Cannes Cinéfondation - La Sélection 2014; etc...) and documentaries (e.g. Trash Dance, SXSW 2012), as well as TV spots and industrial videos. 
<br><br>
	Yet, his sharpest skill is to not be heard so <u>you</u> can be listened to."</h2>
