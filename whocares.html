	<h2><p align="justify">Blessed and cursed by the fact that ears do not have "earlids", Rui Silva listens to the world like your film depends on it -- and that's because it does. From freezing whole casts and crews on sets in order to get the perfect room tone, to positively stomping around things on the Foley stage, having conversations in the ADR booth, creating effects than can affect, and latching his brain on apparent Pro Tools havoc until the printmasters are ready, he has made his presence invisible in a few films, features (e.g. The Retrieval, Chris Eska, SXSW 2013; Wuss, Clay Liford, 2012), shorts (e.g. The Horse Bride, Simon Quiroz, 2012; Small Paranoid Machines, Alvaro Torres-Crespo, 2013; Standing Water, Kyle Seaquist, 2013) and documentaries (e.g. Trash Dance, SXSW 2012), as well as TV spots and industrial videos. The most important part of his workflow is to not be heard so you can listen and be listened to.
<br><br>
	His biggest achievement is to not make much sounds while designing the sound you want to hear.</h2>
